# Volley Pong

_A multi-player racquet sport that is a mix between Volley Ball and Table Tennis (sort of...)._

## Description

A designated player from the serving team will commence in _service_. The player serves the ball to the opposing side in the same way that a "Doubles Table Tennis" match would be served.

Each player on the returning side "sets" the ball (ie. hits the ball up for the next teammate). The ball is set between each teammate at least once before an offensive play is attempted.

The returning team either commits an error and yields the point to the opposition; or, an offensive attempt is made by returning the ball to the original side of the table for the other team to handle. The process continues until one of the teams score.

## Starting the game

Team on the most Northern side does the first _service_. In the event where there is no most Northern team, the most Eastern team will serve first.

## Number of players

- The number of players _MUST_ be symmetrical. In other words, there must not be a different number of players on one team compared to the other.

- Three (3) to five (5) players is ideal for continuous gameplay (although any number of players is permitted as previously mentioned).

## Positions

Players usually form a semi-circle around their side of the table. This is, however, not required since some players might choose to stand further back for defensive purposes.

In a typical game consisting of 3 - 5 players per team, there is on player in the middle (on deck to be the server). The other players are in the surrounding areas of the table.

When a service is complete, the players rotate in a clockwise fashion.

## Service

Each team will serve the ball Five (5) times before alternating to the opposing team.

The service is similar to a serve in "Doubles Table Tennis," where the following criteria are met:

1. The ball is tossed straight up by the server at least 6 inches.
2. It is struck, and bounces on the server's side of the table first, over the net, the bounces on the opposing team's side of the table.

In the case where the ball hits the net and rolls over, it is considered a "let" and the serve is redone without any points awarded. This does not count as a fault.

_The side of which the serve hits on the table is not relevant._

During a service run, which is defined by consecutive serves by the same person, the server is allowed one (1) service fault without any points awarded to the opposing team. Upon the first game-point reached by a team, the current service run will always be reset, allowing for another service fault with no points awarded.

## Scoring

In order to win the match, a team must:

- Be the first to reach 21 points.
- Have a 2 point lead.

If 21 is reached but there is not a lead of 2 points, then the game continues until the 2 point lead is reached.

## Defense

A round of defence starts when either the ball is served into play, or the opposing team makes an offensive strike.

Like in standard ping pong, touching the ball with any part of the body except the racket hand is not permitted unless the ball
passes the end line of the table without bouncing, in which case the point is automatically awarded to the receiver. Touching
the ball before it either passes the end line or bounces is a point for the offense.

NOTE: No player shall hit the ball two times in a row. Ever!

## Offense

Once each single player on one side has set the ball up at least one time, an offensive strike is permitted, but not required. The team could continue setting the ball, assuming that a player never hits the ball twice in a row.

An offensive strike is defined when any player on the offensive team strikes the ball to the opposing team's side of the table. **An offensive strike will be deemed illegal if the offensive player's bat goes above their head during the swing and result in the opposing team receiving a point.**

An offensive strike must bounce on the opposing team's side of the table one time.  Any more bounces is a point yielded to the offending team.  If the ball does not bounce one time on the opposing side, then the point goes to the opposing team.

**NOTE: Returning the ball to the opposing side IS NOT PERMITTED if during the point of contact with the ball the offensive player's bat goes passed the physical or logical line dividing the table (ie. the net).**

## Equipment

The game is typically played with table tennis paddles and a table tennis ball. Although there _could_ be alternatives, each player should use the same type of paddle.

## Surroundings

There are surrounding surfaces that are considered "fair game" and will keep the ball in play.

- The table.
- Vertical surfaces that are NOT human (eg. walls).
- Pipes (the cylindrical shape presents too much grey area).

# Glossary

## spike

A spike is defined as a final shot or attack following a volley, returned to the opposing side hit in such a manner that the ball becomes much more difficult to return, and in some cases is not returnable.

## Service Run

A service run is a consecutive serves initiating play performed by the same individual. During a normal game, service runs are typically five serves long. A service run can be shorter or longer during game-point serves.

## Service Fault

A service fault is any case where, under normal circumstances, a point would be awarded to the opposing team due to a service error.
